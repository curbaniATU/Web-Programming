            I'm interested in web development as web based applications have been apart of my day to day life for the better part of a decade. I decided to take this course as I was excited to learn about better design philosophies when it comes to web development. The course description also mentioned learning about the connections between web apps and databases, which I would like to further my knowledge on.
